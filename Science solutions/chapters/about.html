<br>
float, water, crop, nutrients, preparation<br>
<br>
游린(a) The same kind of plants grown and cultivated on a large scale at a place is called <u><b>Crop</u></b><br>
游린(b) The first step before growing crops is <u><b>preparation</u></b> of the soil.<br>
游린(c) Damaged seeds would <u><b>float</u></b> on top of the water.<br>
游린(d) For growing a crop, sufficient sunlight and <u><b>water</u></b>and <u><b>nutrients</u></b>from the soil are essential.<br>


<h3><u>游눠Keywords</u></h3>

游릳(1).<b>Agricultural Practices</b> - are activities in a particular sequence undertaken by farmers over a period of time to cultivate a good crop.<br>
<br>
游릳(2).<b>Animal husbandry</b> - The science that deals with breeding, feeding and caring of domestic animals is called Animal husbandry.<br>
<br>
游릳(3).<b>Crop</b> - Plants of same kind grown on at place on a large scale is called Crop.<br>
<br>

<br>
游릳(5). <b>Granaries</b> - is a building or storage room specially designed to store threashed grain an other farm feed.<br>
<br>
游릳(6). <b>Harvesting</b> - the process of cutting and gathering of crop after its maturing is called harvesting.<br>
<br>

<br>

<h3>Question 3.</h3>
<h3>Give two examples of each.</h3>
<b>(a) Kharif crop</b> -  Paddy and maize<br>
<b>(b) Rabi crop</b> - Wheat and gram<br>
<br>

<h3>Question 4.</h3>
<b>Write a paragraph in your own words on each of the following.</b><br>

<b>(a) Preparation of soil</b><br>
(a) Preparation of soil: Soil preparation is necessary before growing a crop. It involves tilling and loosening the soil. This allows the roots to penetrate deep in the soil and to breath easily even when they are deep.<br>

<br>

<b>(b) Sowing</b><br>
 Sowing: The process of putting seeds into the soil is called sowing. The tool used traditionally for sowing seeds is funnel-shaped. Nowadays a seed drill is used for sowing with the help of tractors. This tool sows the seed uniformly at a proper distance and depth.<br>

<br>

<b>(c) Weeding</b><br>
Weeding: Some undesirable plants grow along with crop and these unwanted plants are called weeds. The process of removing these unwanted plants is called weeding.<br>

<br>

<b>(d) Threshing</b><br>
The process of separating the grain seeds from the chaff is called threshing.<br>

<br>


<h3>Question 6.</h3><br>
<b>What is irrigation? Describe two methods of irrigation which conserve water</b><br>
The artificial method of watering the plants for assisting in their growth is called irrigation. Main sources of irrigation are wells, tube-wells, ponds, lakes, rivers.
Two methods which help us to conserve water are:<br>
<b>(i) Sprinkler irrigation system:</b> This irrigation system has an arrangement of vertical pipes with rotating nozzles on the top. It is more useful in the uneven and sandy land where sufficient water is not available.Drip irrigation systems.
